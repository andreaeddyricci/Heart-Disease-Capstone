# Heart-Disease-Capstone

## Problem Identification

**The Question**: What can be developed that informs Great Lakes Hospital whether a person will have a cardiovascular disease based on their characteristics, habits, or other factors?

**The Audience**: The results will be presented to the Marketing and Analytics team for use and distribution to the medical teams and the surrounding public.

**The Data**: Dataset from the CDC taken from a nationwide telephone survey in 2020 about US residentsâ€™ health status.  The data included 401,958 rows and 279 columns, but was reduced to 18.  The reduced data can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease).

**The Modeling Response**: heart disease = 1, no heart disease = 0

**The Model**: Binary supervised classification using Naive Briggs with a Recall score of 70% and ROC AUC score of 82%

**The Deliverables**: Jupyter notebooks of data wrangling through modeling, a final report, and a presentation
